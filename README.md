# Clustering-CreditCase


File1 : Clustering Practice Case with K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN Clustering. 
I split the data in 2 sets. 
- Dataset A :
1. Skilled (2) and High Skilled(3) Job
2. Own Housing
3. Quite rich and rich in saving accounts
- Dataset B :
1. Unskilled and non-resident, unskilled and resindent Job
2. Rent or Free housing
3. little and moderate in saving accounts


File2 : Clustering Practice Case - Bonus Part
- Without dropping missing value,
- Without splitting datasetA & datasetB 
- I only use K-Means Clustering
